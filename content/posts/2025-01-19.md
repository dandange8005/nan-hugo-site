What started as a simple search for an image processing tool turned into an unexpected journey into app development, all thanks to AI.

I was working on improving my blog posts and wanted to add relevant images to enhance the reading experience. Rather than using generic stock photos or searching through royalty-free images from services like Unsplash or Pexels, I decided to explore AI image generation to create visuals that would hopefully match my content. After some research, I found a promising tool on [junia.ai](https://www.junia.ai/tools/blog-images) that produced decent results.

Using the blog's description, I generated my first AI image. However, I encountered a limitation - the image's ratio was fixed at 1:1, and I needed to optimize it for better loading speed and SEO. I quickly realised that my Mac lacked a suitable image processing tool for simple tasks like cropping, ratio adjustment, and optimisation for web. While macOS had some built-in options, I wanted to avoid heavy applications like Photoshop that felt like overkill for such basic tasks.

My search for alternatives online only led to bloated applications or paid solutions - neither of which I wanted. Frustrated, I turned to AI assistants like ChatGPT and Claude for recommendations. What happened next surprised me.

Instead of simply suggesting existing tools, Claude started coding - something could've been avoided had I put more specific instructions in the prompt. It wrote a small web application using Electron - a framework that allows developers to create cross-platform desktop applications with web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Though uncertain if this was what I wanted, I decided to give it a try. I copied the code into VS Code, initialized Git to track changes, and ran npm start. The coolest thing happened - without writing a single line of code myself, I had created a web application that actually solved my problem - all thanks to GenAI. While the initial version wasn't perfect, lacking features like aspect ratio control, image preview, and custom file naming, it successfully handled the core functionality: converting images to the web-optimised .webp format. All I needed to do was add some additional features. It felt like a Tony Stark moment - having an AI assistant help me build exactly what I needed.

After a few tweaks, I have a workable imaging processing app that has the following functions:
- Image preview for uploaded files
- Custom width and height settings
- 16:9 aspect ratio option
- Multiple output format choices
- Quality adjustment
- Custom output file naming

This experience opened my eyes to the potential of AI-assisted development. What began as a search for an image processing tool evolved into building my own solution, demonstrating how AI can empower users to create custom solutions for their specific needs.
