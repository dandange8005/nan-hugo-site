## Project Information

### Overview

During the COVID-19 pandemic, medical students faced unprecedented challenges in practicing their clinical skills. As the leading developer, I helped create an innovative virtual environment that simulated Integrated Structured Clinical Examinations (ISCEs), enabling remote practice while maintaining educational quality and assessment validity.

### Key Information

- 12 total stations (6 for Year 2, 6 for Year 4)
- Each station combines 360Â° Virtual Stations with Xerte learning objects
- Stations numbered B1 to B6
- Includes existing ISCE content adapted for virtual format

### Project Timeline
- **April 8, 2020:** Initial deadline set for April 20th
- **April 14-23, 2020**: Initial development and content gathering
- **April 30, 2020**: First stations (Year 2 and 4) developed for review 
- **May 13, 2020**: Plan to complete all stations by end of May
- **June 4, 2020**: Deployment to Learning Central
- **July 2020**: Preparation for new academic year implementation

## Key Achievements

* Successfully developed virtual ISCEs for Year 2 and Year 4 medical students
* Engaged 400+ students across multiple year groups
* Generated 1,300+ views across examination stations
* Recorded 10,000+ student interactions
* Received positive student and staff feedback
* Created enhanced Year 4 stations following successful launch

## Technical Implementation

### Technologies Used
* Yi 360 camera for panoramic image capture
* Marzipano app for virtual tour development
* Xerte for learning object creation

### My Role & Responsibilities

As the leading developer, I was responsible for:

1. **Virtual Environment Creation**
   * Developed 360-degree virtual tours using Yi 360 camera
   * Implemented Marzipano for tour functionality
   * Created immersive learning environments

2. **Learning Content Development**
   * Designed and developed half of all learning activities using Xerte
   * Created interactive elements for student engagement
   * Integrated assessment components

3. **Technical Implementation**
   * Implemented custom JavaScript functions for question flow control
   * Designed popup overlays within virtual tours
   * Integrated navigation controls
   * Ensured accessibility compliance

4. **Project Coordination**
   * Collaborated with clinical skills teams
   * Coordinated with assessment teams
   * Managed stakeholder requirements

## Impact & Feedback

The project received positive feedback from students, with one noting:

> "I have just started the Virtual ISCE online learning, and wanted to email to say that I think this is a fantastic resource. Very useful to see examples of good consultations and full ISCE stations, it helped me straighten the structure in my mind and gives a good practice."

## Skills Developed

* Advanced virtual reality implementation
* Educational technology integration
* Cross-departmental project coordination
* User experience design
* Accessibility optimisation
* Clinical skills assessment design

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenges Faced
