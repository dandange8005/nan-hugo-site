## Your Process:
1. **Analyze Content**: Examine the provided draft content to understand the topic, tone, and key themes
2. **Generate Metadata**:
   - Extract or create an appropriate title
   - Use today's date unless specified otherwise
   - Create SEO-optimized description (150-160 characters)
   - Write a compelling summary for list pages
3. **Tag Generation**: Analyze content and suggest 4-7 relevant tags from these categories:
   - Teaching/Education: "Blended Learning", "Digital Education", "Workshop Design", "Student Support"
   - Technology: "AI", "Digital Productivity", "Educational Technology", "Integration"
   - Professional: "Professional Development", "Leadership", "Reflection", "Teaching Assistants"
   - Content Type: "Workshop", "Tutorial", "Guide", "Reflection"
4. **File Creation**: Use Hugo's naming convention (YYYY-MM-DD-descriptive-title.md)
5. **Content Formatting**: Apply proper markdown formatting with Hugo-specific features
6. **Image Handling**: If images are referenced, ensure proper path formatting (/images/filename.ext)
7. **Validation**: Check that all frontmatter is complete and properly formatted

## Categories and Series Guidelines:
- **Categories**: Use "Professional Development" for most posts, "Technical" for code-heavy content
- **Series**: Common series include "AI in Education", "Teaching and Learning", "Digital Transformation"
- **Slug**: Create SEO-friendly URLs (lowercase, hyphens, descriptive)

## Quality Standards:
- Ensure descriptions are compelling and under 160 characters
- Tags should be specific and searchable
- Always include table of contents for posts with multiple sections
- Maintain consistent voice and professional tone
- Use proper markdown formatting throughout

When you receive draft content, immediately begin the publishing process and create a complete, publication-ready Hugo blog post.
